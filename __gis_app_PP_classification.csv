2. Purpose Limitation: The policy vaguely mentions that the data collected is only used for improving app features, but it does not explicitly limit the use of data just for that purpose.

Secondly, the policy does not clearly limit the purposes for data collection as it vaguely states that the data is used to provide and improve the service, making the policy open to broad interpretations. Thirdly, the policy does not highlight a commitment to data minimization and does not inform users about limiting data collection to only what is necessary. Fourthly, no explicit measures for ensuring data accuracy or mechanisms for users to update or correct their data are stated. In addition, while the policy asserts they use ""commercially acceptable means of protecting"" personal information, it does not detail specific security measures like encryption or regular security assessments.

The Purpose Limitation and Data Minimization are not explicitly mentioned. It does not specify the methods for users to correct or update their data, therefore failing the Accuracy criteria. There are no clear definitions or criteria for storage limitation and data retention periods. Furthermore, while there is a mention of security measures, concrete examples like encryption or regular security assessments are not provided, which questions the Integrity and Confidentiality. Lastly, the policy does not provide a clear process of data deletion or anonymization after the purpose is fulfilled causing to question on Storage Limitation."

There are several reasons for this conclusion, specifically:
- While it mentions fairness and lawfulness, such as making sure data isn't shared, it doesn't explain clearly if this is legally based and how the data processing is lawful.
- Purpose Limitation is somewhat addressed as they mention using Gmail Authentication only for sending automated emails, however, there isn't a clear limitation on the other data uses and the policy does not ensure data is not used for incompatible purposes without additional consent.
- Data Minimization criterion seems to be ignored as the policy does not emphasize limiting data collection to what is essential for the stated purpose.
- Accuracy: The policy does not mention any mechanisms in place that allow users to update or correct their data.
- The expectation of Storage Limitation is not fulfilled. The policy does not define clear retention periods or criteria for determining these periods. It doesn't indicate processes for data deletion or anonymization.
- Regarding Integrity and Confidentiality, the policy only assures user data is safe and secure, but it does not detail any security measures taken to protect data such as encryption methods or regular security assessments."

The policy doesn't indicate clear lawful reasons for using the user's data, and the language isn't straightforward to facilitate understanding. The policy doesn't outline specific limitations on data usage purposes and doesn't demonstrate an effort to minimize data collection to only what is essential for the defined purposes. The policy also lacks clarity on retention periods as well as the process of data deletion or anonymization after the intended purpose is met. The commitment to data accuracy and maintaining user control over their data is not present. Finally, the policy does not include any mention of regular security assessments, and explanation of its security measures is very general and unspecific."

1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency: The language is not simple or transparent. It doesn't clearly state its legal basis for data processing.
2. Purpose Limitation: The purposes for data collection aren't clearly defined, it mentions using information to provide ""a personalized, useful and efficient experience"", but this is vague. It does not ensure data isn't used for incompatible purposes without additional consent.
3. Data Minimization: The policy does not specify collecting only necessary data. It does mention they don't collect personal information, but this is contradicted elsewhere in the document where it's stated that names and email addresses can be given.
4. Accuracy: There are no clear measures in place to ensure data accuracy and the policy lacks mechanisms for users to update or correct their data.
5. Storage Limitation: The document doesn't define clear retention periods or criteria for determining these periods. It has no process for data deletion or anonymization after the purpose is fulfilled.
6. Integrity and Confidentiality: It does mention that they ""employ administrative, physical and electronic measures"" to protect data, but these aren't specified. The statement ""no security measures that we take to protect your information is absolutely guaranteed to avoid unauthorized access or use"" contradicts claims of adequate data protection measures."
